 Lab 2 — Networking & Packet Capture (Wireshark)

 Resolved Host IP
Command used:
    dig +short streamhive.42web.io

Resolved IP:
    185.27.134.119



Active Network Interface
Command used:
    ip addr show

Interface used for tcpdump capture:
    wlan0

  Traffic Capture
Tcpdump command used:
    sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 host 185.27.134.119 -w lab2_streamhive.pcap

Traffic generated using:
    curl -vk https://streamhive.42web.io/

(Also optionally accessed in Firefox.)



 Wireshark Filters Used

Show TCP packets:
    tcp

Show packets to/from the target IP:
    ip.addr == 185.27.134.119

 Show TLS handshake:
    tls

Show ClientHello:
    tls.handshake.type == 1

Show SYN (start of TCP handshake):
    tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0



Optional TLS Decryption (if used)
Commands:
    export SSLKEYLOGFILE=~/sslkeys.log
    firefox &

Wireshark configuration:
    Preferences → Protocols → TLS →
    (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename:
        /home/<yourusername>/sslkeys.log

Deliverables Included

- TCP 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK)
- ClientHello
- ServerHello
- Certificate
- TLS Application Data

✔ screenshots
Contains:
- handshake.png (TCP handshake)
- clienthello.png (TLS ClientHello packet)
- cert.png (TLS Certificate message)

 ✔ report.pdf
300–500 word explanation including:
- TCP handshake packet numbers
- TLS handshake packet numbers
- Description of encrypted traffic
